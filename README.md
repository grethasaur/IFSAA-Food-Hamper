#### Challenges Faced
**Limited data duration**
Challenge: Less than a year’s data limits historical context, making it difficult to capture annual trends or predict recurring demand spikes around key events.
Impact: Constrained to short-term insights on current seasonal patterns. Long-term trend predictions remain unreliable.

**Data Quality & Ambiguity in Columns**
Challenge: Unclear column meanings complicated decisions on data inclusion, risking exclusion of useful information.
Impact: Analysis focused on clear, interpretable columns (address, dates, quantity, language), ensuring reliability but possibly limiting deeper insights.
